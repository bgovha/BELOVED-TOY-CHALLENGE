        <h2>My Favorite Toy</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite toy is my toy kitchen. I love it because it allows me to
            play pretend and cook delicious meals for my family and friends. I can
            use my imagination to create all sorts of dishes, and it helps me learn
            about cooking and food.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy playing with my toy kitchen because it is colorful and has
            realistic features like pots, pans, and utensils. It also has a little
            oven and stove where I can pretend to bake and cook. Playing with it
            makes me feel like a real chef like my dad!
